# Compounding Knowledge

## Definition

Knowledge that **accumulates over time** in a structured artifact (the wiki) rather than being rediscovered from raw sources on every query.

## Why it matters

Subtle questions requiring synthesis across five documents fail in [[concepts/rag|RAG]] because the system must find and piece together fragments each time. A maintained wiki already has cross-references, flagged contradictions, and an evolving synthesis.

## At scale

When the wiki grows, add hybrid retrieval via [[concepts/hybrid-search]] — the structured pages remain the source of truth.
